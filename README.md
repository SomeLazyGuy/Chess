# Chess Program
Welcome to my Chess program made in Unity! This is my first major project, and it allows you to play local games against other people or challenge the Stockfish 16 chess engine.

## Features
- Play local games against other players or against Stockfish 16.
- Enjoy a classic chess experience with intuitive controls.
- Choose from different difficulty levels when playing against Stockfish 16.

## Disclaimer
Please note that this program is still a work in progress. The code might not be as clean or optimized as it could be, considering it's my first big project. I'm constantly learning and improving my programming skills, so bear with me as I continue to enhance this chess program.

## Bug Reports
If you encounter any bugs or issues while using the program, please don't hesitate to let me know. Your feedback is invaluable in helping me identify and fix any problems. While I may not be able to address them immediately, I'll do my best to allocate time to resolve them in future updates.

## Installation
To run the chess program on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the Unity editor.
3. Open the project in the Unity editor and compile and execute the program.

When using the installer included in the release section, it is required to start the game with admin privileges, although the exact reason behind this requirement is unknown to me. On the other hand, when building the program from the source code, it runs smoothly without the need for admin privileges.
